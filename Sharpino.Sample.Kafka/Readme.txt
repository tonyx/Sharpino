If you have Kafka installed locally using the quick guide setup from the website, then you just need to create
topics according to the CreateTopics.sh scripts

Then you can test the sample application with kafka (see MultiVersionsTests.fs in the Sharpino.Sample.Tests and 
the allVersions list of triples)
