### same as  Example 5, just cleaner and without the SAFE stack

Recap: what if we would like to inject rules related to aggregate constraints using metaprogramming/quoted expressions?
Some experiments in this code are about this.

Particularly: some bookings are acceptable and some are not, and we can change those rules "on the fly" by
injecting the rules to the system.
